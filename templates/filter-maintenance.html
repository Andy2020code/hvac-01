                    <p>Ensure your air conditioning system is turned off. This will prevent the fan from circulating dust while you're working.</p>

                    <h1>Locate the Air Filter</h1>
                    <p>Depending on your HVAC system, the air filter is typically located in one of the following places:</p>
                    <span class="list-01">In a slot on the return air duct near the furnace or air handler.<br>
                        In a return air grille in a wall or ceiling.<br>
                        In the air handler unit itself.</span>

                    <p>If you have a disposable filter, gently slide it out from its slot. If you have a reusable filter, follow the manufacturer's instructions for removal.</p>

                    <h1>Inspect the Filter</h1>
                    <p>Examine the old filter to gauge its condition. If it's disposable, check for any visible dirt and debris. If it's a reusable filter, assess its washable condition.</p>

                    <h1>Disposable Filters:</h1>
                    <p>If it's visibly dirty or if you've been using it for longer than the recommended period (typically every 1-3 months), replace it with a new one of the same size and type.</p>
                    <h1>Reusable Filters:</h1>
                    <p>If it's washable, remove it and follow the manufacturer's cleaning instructions. Typically, this involves rinsing the filter with water and allowing it to dry completely before reinstalling.</p>
                    <p>If the filter is damaged or deteriorating, it's time to replace it.</p>

                    <h1>Schedule Regular Maintenance</h1>
                    <p>Make it a routine to check and clean or replace your A/C filter as recommended by the manufacturer or at least every 1-3 months. Set reminders to ensure it doesn't get neglected.</p>
                    <p>Keeping your A/C filter clean not only enhances your system's efficiency but also helps maintain good indoor air quality. Clean air filters promote better airflow and can lead to energy savings and a longer lifespan for your HVAC system.</p>
